Code for a 4th year uni module on text processing.


# Assignment1
assignment1 is a document retrival task. All of my code is in `my-retriever.py`.

# Assignment2
assignment2 is a huffman encoding task.
Only the `huff-compress.py` and `huff-decompress.py` files were allowed to be submitted, and they would not be allowed to load each other so there is some code duplication.
`test-harness.py` is a supplied runner script, and `metrics.py` is a modified version of `test-harness.py` which runs the encoding and decoding with an extra `--bench` flag which enables timing code.
